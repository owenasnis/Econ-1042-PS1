```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(estimatr)

```

## Setup 

```{r data wrangling}

kickers <- read_csv("kickers_v2.csv",
                    show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  rename(., "ID" = "...1") %>%
  mutate(Grass = if_else(Grass == TRUE, 1, 0))

```

## Question 1

```{r Q1}

min(kickers$Distance)
max(kickers$Distance)
mean(kickers$Distance)
median(kickers$Distance)

kickers %>% 
  filter(Distance == max(Distance))

```

## Question 2

```{r Q2}

forty_to_fortyfive <- kickers %>%
  filter(Distance %in% (40:45))

mean(forty_to_fortyfive$Success) * 100

over_fortyfive <- kickers %>% 
  filter(Distance > 45)

mean(over_fortyfive$Success) * 100

```

## Question 3

```{r Q3}

grass_only <- kickers %>% 
  filter(Grass == 1)

mean(grass_only$Success) * 100

turf_only <- kickers %>% 
  filter(Grass == 0)

mean(turf_only$Success) * 100

lm1 <- lm_robust(Success ~ Grass, data = kickers)
summary(lm1)

```

## Question 4 

```{r Q4}

cor(kickers$Distance, kickers$Grass)
cor(kickers$Distance, kickers$Success)

```

## Question 5
