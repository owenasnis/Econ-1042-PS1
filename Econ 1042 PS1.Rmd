## Setup 

```{r setup}

library(tidyverse)

kickers <- read_csv("kickers_v2.csv",
                    show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  rename(., "ID" = "...1") %>%
  mutate(Grass = if_else(Grass == TRUE, 1, 0))

```

## Question 1

```{r Q1}

# a 
min(kickers$Distance)
max(kickers$Distance)
mean(kickers$Distance)
median(kickers$Distance)

# c
kickers %>% 
  filter(Distance == max(Distance))

```

## Question 2

```{r Q2}

forty_to_fortyfive <- kickers %>%
  filter(Distance %in% (40:45))

mean(forty_to_fortyfive$Success) * 100

over_fortyfive <- kickers %>% 
  filter(Distance > 45)

mean(over_fortyfive$Success) * 100

```
